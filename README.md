# Hammerwatch Archipelago Mod Installer

This is the Archipelago mod installer for the hack and slash dungeon crawler game Hammerwatch. Check out [archipelago.gg](https://archipelago.gg/) or 
the [Archipelago GitHub](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases) for information about what Archipelago is!

## Hammerwatch Mod Installation Procedures

Download and extract the .zip file containing the installer and necessary files from the 
[Releases](https://github.com/Parcosmic/Hammerwatch-Archipelago-Mod-Installer/releases) page. Run HammerwatchAPInstaller.exe, and
in the file dialogue box select your Hammerwatch executable (Hammerwatch.exe), or navigate to it if it is not
automatically selected. If the installer displays the message "Patching successful!" you know the mod is successfully
installed! You may launch Hammerwatch as normal using Steam to play with Archipelago.

To uninstall the mod run APModUninstall.bat to remove all mod files.

For more information about installation, generating a game, or using the mod see the 
[Hammerwatch Randomizer Setup Guide](https://github.com/Parcosmic/Hammerwatch-Archipelago/blob/dev/worlds/hammerwatch/docs/setup_en.md)
