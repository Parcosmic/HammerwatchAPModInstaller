# Hammerwatch Archipelago Mod Installer

This is the new Archipelago mod installer for the hack and slash dungeon crawler game Hammerwatch. Many thanks to [kl3cks7r](https://github.com/kl3cks7r) for help with developing it!

Also check out [archipelago.gg](https://archipelago.gg/) or the [Archipelago GitHub](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases) for information about what Archipelago is!

## Hammerwatch Mod Installation Procedures

Download and extract the .zip file containing the built installer and necessary files from the 
[HammerwatchAPMod Releases](https://github.com/Parcosmic/HammerwatchAPMod/releases) page. Run HammerwatchAPModInstaller.exe, and
in the file dialogue box select your Hammerwatch executable (Hammerwatch.exe), or navigate to it if it is not
automatically selected. If the installer displays the message "Patching successful!" you know the mod is successfully
installed! You may launch Hammerwatch as normal using Steam to play with Archipelago.

To uninstall the mod run APModUninstall.bat to remove all mod files.

For more information about installation, generating a game, or using the mod see the 
[Hammerwatch Randomizer Setup Guide](https://github.com/Parcosmic/Hammerwatch-Archipelago/blob/dev/worlds/hammerwatch/docs/setup_en.md)
